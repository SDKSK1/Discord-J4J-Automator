### How to use 
1) Put your token where it says token-here - on line 5
2) Put your message in the " " on like 4
3) Run the program!

You will need to join some join for join servers, a big one
I know of is discord.gg/j4j. Send a message saying something
like "j4j dm me" or start dming people "j4j?"

As soon as a server link is sent to you, this program will
make a POST request to the server via your token and join
the new server, if that goes ok it will reply to the user
saying "I joined [their server name]", and then your message,
something along the lines of "Please join my server
[your server name]"

---

### Future Plans
- Add a list of servers the bot will join at random and 
automatically message users and/or channels
- Warning people or leaving their server if they don't 
join or leave after joining

### Warning
This is a POC, I do not encourage the use of this as it's classifed
as a selfbot and violates Discord's TOS!
