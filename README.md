# Discord-J4J-Automator

This will most likely get your account sms locked / banned.
Please use an alt

How to use - put your token where it says token-here - on line 5
Put your message in the " " on like 4
Run the program!

You will need to join some join for join servers a big one I know of is discord.gg/j4j
Type something like "j4j dm me" or start dming people "j4j?"

As soon as a server link is sent to you, this program will make a post request to the server via your token and join it, if that goes ok it will reply saying "I joined [their server]" , and then your message, something along the lines of "please join my server [server]"

In the future I will consider putting a selection of j4j servers, making the bot pick a j4j server and channel channel and auto messaging it , or even making the bot dm people a server if they write "j4j" but I can see accounts getting disabled VERY FAST, then giving people a warning if they don't join the selected server and leaving if they still don't.

(This was a demo, I do not expect / encourage you to use it as it's a selfbot and violates discord's tos!)
